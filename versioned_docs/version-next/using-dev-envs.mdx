We set up everything in the [previous section](/docs/next/getting-started) of the getting started guide. In this section, let's do the fun bits of developing our application in a Development Environment. We will continue using the Movies app we talked about in the [previous section](/docs/next/getting-started/#getting-your-application-ready), but feel free to use any other application after you've [configured it](/docs/getting-started/#getting-your-application-ready).

## One Command To Rule Them All

Run the follwing command to launch your development envrionment:

Based on whether you're using the [Helm version](https://github.com/okteto/movies-with-helm) of the Movies app or the [Docker compose one](https://github.com/okteto/movies-with-compose), you'll have differnet steps to take:

<Tabs>
   <TabItem value="docker" label="Movies app with Docker compose file">

     ```console
     $ git clone https://github.com/okteto/movies-with-compose
$ cd movies-with-compose
```
```console
$ okteto up
```
    Since we already have a Docker compose file, generating the [Okteto manifest](/docs/next/cloud/okteto-cli/#okteto-manifest) isn't compulsary. You can still choose to do that by running `okteto init` before this step if you want more configuration. Unlike the Helm version, for this one, on running `okteto up` you should directly see a prompt asking you which one of your microserices you want to develop:
  
    ```console
     ‚úì  Development container 'api' configured successfully
     ‚úì  Development container 'frontend' configured successfully
        Select the development container you want to activate:
        Use the arrow keys to navigate: ‚Üì ‚Üë ‚Üí ‚Üê
      ‚ñ∏ api
        frontend
    ```

    Let's go with `api` because we know there's a bug there we need to fix üôÇ

    Once you do that you should see Okteto CLI building the required Docker images for your microserices. When it is done building the images, it will start deploying your application to Okteto Cloud. You should see the deployed endpoints as part of the output in the CLI:

    ```console
    Success! Your application will be available shortly.
    i  Endpoints available:
     - https://movies-with-helm-cindylopez.cloud.okteto.net/
     - https://movies-with-helm-cindylopez.cloud.okteto.net/api
    ```

    You should be able to view your applcation when you visit these endpoints. These endpoints are also shown in the Okteto Cloud dashboard:

    <p align="center">
    <Image
        src="/docs/images/endpoints.png"
        alt="UI showing the movies app"
        width="850"
    />
    </p>

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="helm" label="Movies app with Helm" default>

    ```console
     $ git clone https://github.com/okteto/movies-with-helm
$ cd movies-with-helm
```
```console
$ okteto up
```
    Since we don't already have an [Okteto manifest](/docs/next/cloud/okteto-cli/#okteto-manifest), the manifest generation will happen as part of this step. Okteto CLI will ask you before generating the manifest:

    ```console
     i  Using cindylopez @ cloud.okteto.com as context
     !  okteto manifest has no 'dev' section.
     ?  Do you want to configure okteto manifest now? [y/n]
    ```
    Press `y` to continue.

    In case your application images aren't already built, you'll also have the option to that as part of this step:

    ```console
    ? Do you need to build any of the following Dockerfiles as part of your development environment?:
    ‚ñ∏ api/Dockerfile
      frontend/Dockerfile
      No, thanks!
    ```
    The images for the Movies app haven't already been built so let's select `api/Dockerfile` first and then `frontend/Dockerfile`.

    Once Okteto CLI is done building the images for you, it will start deploying your application to Okteto Cloud. You should see the deployed endpoints as part of the output in the CLI:

    ```console
    Success! Your application will be available shortly.
    i  Endpoints available:
     - https://movies-with-helm-cindylopez.cloud.okteto.net/
     - https://movies-with-helm-cindylopez.cloud.okteto.net/api
    ```

    You should be able to view your applcation when you visit these endpoints. These endpoints are also shown in the Okteto Cloud dashboard:
    <p align="center">
    <Image
        src="/versioned_docs/version-next/endpoints.png"
        alt="UI showing the movies app"
        width="850"
    />
    </p>

    At this point Okteto CLI would have generated the Okteto manifest for you and would be prompting you to choose which one of your microserices you want to develop:

    ```console
     ‚úì  Development container 'api' configured successfully
     ‚úì  Development container 'frontend' configured successfully
     ‚úì  Okteto manifest (okteto.yml) configured successfully
        Select the development container you want to activate:
        Use the arrow keys to navigate: ‚Üì ‚Üë ‚Üí ‚Üê
      ‚ñ∏ api
        frontend
    ```

    Let's go with `api` because we know there's a bug there we need to fix üôÇ

    ```console
 ‚úì  Development container 'frontend' selected
 ‚úì  Images successfully pulled
 ‚úì  Files synchronized
    Context:   cloud.okteto.com
    Namespace: cindylopez
    Name:      frontend
    Forward:   8080 -> 80
               9229 -> 9229

Welcome to your development container. Happy coding!
cindylopez:api app>
```

Once the dev environment is up, we need to start our application as if we would if we were developing on a local machine (excpet we're actually leveraging cloud resources!). For the Movies app we chose, this can be done by running:

``console
cindylopez:api app> yarn start
```

Once you do this you should see the movie thubmnails back again on the frontend endpoint!

  </TabItem>
 
</Tabs>

The next time you run `okteto up`, you'll not see all the steps realted to the initial setup and will be directly prompted to choose which microserice you want to develop.

Behind the scenes this Dev Environment relies on a development container that replaces the container running in the deployed instance of your application.

A file synchronization service is started to keep the changes you make to your code locally up-to-date with your development container. Once your dev container has started, a remote shell is launched for you - this means you can now develop and test your deployed application exactly as if it were on your local machine! (except it's not!)



## Development Time!

Looking at the frotnend endpoint for the Movies app, something doesn't look right here, does it?

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src="/versioned_docs/version-next/images/ui-movies.png"
    alt="UI showing the movies app"
    width="850"
  />
</p>

The list of movies is the same as Cindy's list. Let's fix that.

Open your favorite IDE on your local machine and edit line 43 in `/api/server.js` to:

```javascript
  db.collection('watching').find().toArray( (err, results) =>{
```

Now save your changes and go back and refresh the browser. Okteto CLI will automatically synchronize your changes to your development container. Take a look at the development container shell and notice how the changes are detected by `nodemon` and automatically hot reloaded.

```console
[nodemon] restarting due to changes...
[nodemon] starting `node server.js`
Server running on port 8080.
```

See the magic?


<p align="center">
  <Image
    src="/versioned_docs/version-next/ui-movies-fixed.png"
    alt="UI showing the movies app"
    width="850"
  />
</p>

Okteto's Development Environment allowed the changes you made to your code locally to reflect immediately on the deployed version of your application. Gone are the troubles of committing and waiting for long CI builds to see how your changes would look in production!

## Next Steps

Now that you know how you get started with Development Environments, you might want to go have a look at Okteto's [Preview Environments](/docs/cloud/preview-environments/preview-environments) too. These enable teams to generate a sharable URL containing the deployed application with changes for each pull request made to a repository!
