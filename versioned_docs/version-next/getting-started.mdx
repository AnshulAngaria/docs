Okteto's Development Environments enable you to work directly with a deployed application and see your code changes live on the cloud as soon as you hit save.

These Dev environments work using a combination of [Okteto Cloud](/docs/next/cloud), which is used to deploy your application, and [Okteto CLI](/docs/next/cloud/okteto-cli), which is used to launch the Dev Environment. This guide will walk you through how you can easily get started with using Dev environments.

## Installing Okteto CLI

Install the Okteto CLI following these steps:

### MacOS / Linux

```console
$ curl https://get.okteto.com -sSfL | sh
```

You can also install it via [brew](https://brew.sh/) by running:

```console
$ brew install okteto
```

### Windows

Download https://downloads.okteto.com/cli/okteto.exe and add it to your `$PATH`.

You can also install it via [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) by running:

```console
$ scoop install okteto
```

### GitHub

Alternatively, you can directly download the binary [from GitHub](https://github.com/okteto/okteto/releases) or build it directly from the source code.

## Configuring Okteto CLI with Okteto Cloud

Okteto CLI works with **any** Kubernetes cluster to create Dev Environments. As part of this guide, we'll be using a free cluster provided by Okteto Cloud. For this, the first thing you need to do is go and [log in](https://cloud.okteto.com). Once you've done that, you need to let Okteto CLI know that Okteto Cloud is where the Development Environment for your application will live. This is done by setting the context in Okteto CLI using:

```console
$ okteto context use https://cloud.okteto.com
```

You have the option of creating multiple [Namespaces](/docs/cloud/namespaces) in Okteto Cloud. We'll just use the default one for this guide, which gets created when you log in. Okteto CLI should automatically pick that Namespace up after you set the context. You can confirm this by running:

```console
$ okteto context list
```
```console
Name                        Namespace             Builder                                 Registry
https://cloud.okteto.com *  cindylopez          tcp://buildkit.cloud.okteto.net:1234    registry.cloud.okteto.net
```

## Getting Your Application Ready

For Okteto CLI to know how to launch your Development Environment, it needs an [Okteto manifest](/docs/next/cloud/okteto-cli/#okteto-manifest). This manifest allows you to provide configuration for your Development Environments. Okteto CLI will analyze any [existing manifests](/docs/next/cloud/okteto-cli/#deployment-manifests) (Helm, Kubernetes, etc.) in your source code directory and help you write an Okteto manifest for your application. The Okteto manifest is necessary in all cases except if you already have a Docker compose file configured for your application.

If Okteto CLI can't find the Okteto manifest for your application, the manifest generation step will happen automatically when we launch our Development Environment. You can also choose to explicitly generate the Okteto manifest using: 

```console
$ okteto init
```

Note that Okteto CLI tries to create the Okteto manifest on a best-effort basis, so it is recommended to take a look at the generated manifest. It would have comments which would help you configure the exact details for your application. 

As part of this guide, we'll be fixing a bug in our sample Movies application. The application consists of a React frontend and a Node.js backend API. We'll be using two different versions of this Movies application - [one](https://github.com/okteto/movies-with-helm) which uses Helm charts, and the [other](https://github.com/okteto/movies-with-compose) which has a Docker compose file configured.


## Next Steps

Now that you have everything configured, let's get to the fun bit of developing our application using our Development Environment. In the next part, we'll launch our Dev Environment and fix a bug in the Movies application!
