Okteto's Development Environments enable you to work directly with a deployed application and see your code changes live on the cloud as soon as you hit save.

These Dev environments work using a combination of [Okteto Cloud](/docs/next/cloud), which is used to deploy your application, and [Okteto CLI](/docs/next/cloud/okteto-cli), which is used to launch the Dev Environment. This guide will walk you through how you can easily get started with using Dev environments.

## Installing Okteto CLI

Install the Okteto CLI following these steps:

### MacOS / Linux

```console
$ curl https://get.okteto.com -sSfL | sh
```

You can also install via [brew](https://brew.sh/) by running:

```console
$ brew install okteto
```

### Windows

Download https://downloads.okteto.com/cli/okteto.exe and add it to your `$PATH`.

You can also install via [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) by running:

```console
$ scoop install okteto
```

### GitHub

Alternatively, you can directly download the binary [from GitHub](https://github.com/okteto/okteto/releases) or build it directly from the source code.

## Configuring Okteto CLI with Okteto Cloud

Okteto CLI works with any Kubernetes cluster to create dev environments. As part of this guide we'll be using a free cluster provided by Okteto Cloud. For this, the first thing you need to do is go and [log in](https://cloud.okteto.com). Once you've done that, you need to let Okteto CLI know that Okteto Cloud is where the Development Environment for your application will live. This is done by setting the context in Okteto CLI using:

```console
$ okteto context use https://cloud.okteto.com
```

You have the option of creating multiple [Namespaces](/docs/cloud/namespaces) in Okteto Cloud. For this guide, we'll just use the default one, which gets created when you log in. Okteto CLI should automatically pick that Namespace up after you set the context. You can confirm this by running:

```console
$ okteto context list
```
```console
Name                        Namespace             Builder                                 Registry
https://cloud.okteto.com *  rinkiyakedad          tcp://buildkit.cloud.okteto.net:1234    registry.cloud.okteto.net
```

## Getting Your Application Ready

For Okteto CLI to know how to launch your Development Envrionment it needs a Okteto manifest. This manifest allows you to provide configuration for your Development Envrionments. Okteto CLI will analyze any existing manifests (Helm, Kubernetes, etc.) in your source code directory and help you write an Okteto manifest for your application. The Okteto manifest is necessary in all cases except if you already have a Docker compose file configured for your applciaiton.

If Okteto CLI can't find the Okteto manifest for your applciation, the manifest generation step will happen automatically when we launch our development environment. You can also choose to explicity generate the Okteto manifest using: 

```console
$ okteto init
```

Note that Okteto CLI tries to create the Okteto Manigest on a best-effort basis so it is recommend to take a look at the generated Manifest. It would have comments based which would help you configure the exact details for your application. 

As part of this guide, we'll be fixing a bug in our sample Movies application. The application consists of a React frontend and a Node.js backend API. We'll be using two versions of this applciation to demostrate. We'll be using two different versions of this Movies applcation - one which uses Helm chart and the other which has a Docker compose file configured.


## Next Steps

Now that you have everything configured let's get to the fun bit of developing our application using our development environment. In the next part, we'll launch our Development Environment and fix a bug in the movies applciation!
