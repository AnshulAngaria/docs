[Okteto Cloud](https://cloud.okteto.com/#/?origin=docs) gives you free access to secure Kubernetes namespaces, fully integrated with remote development capabilities.
Develop your Kubernetes applications in Okteto Cloud and forget about slow and tedious local development forever.

With Okteto Cloud you can:

- Deploy your applications from [Git Repositories](/docs/previous/cloud/deploy-from-git/), [Docker Compose](/docs/previous/tutorials/stacks-getting-started/) files or [Helm Charts](/docs/previous/cloud/deploy-from-helm/).
- Configure how your application gets deployed using an [Okteto Pipeline](/docs/previous/cloud/okteto-pipeline).
- Configure [Secrets](/docs/previous/cloud/secrets/) and prevent secure credentials from being stored in version control.
- Expose your application via [Automatic HTTPs Endpoints](/docs/previous/cloud/ssl/) for your services, [Private Endpoints](/docs/previous/cloud/private-endpoints/) to restrict access, and [Custom Domain Names](/docs/previous/cloud/custom-domains/).
- Build your application images directly in the cloud using the [Okteto Build Service](/docs/previous/cloud/build).
- Store your container images in [Okteto Registry](/docs/previous/cloud/registry).
- Create secure Kubernetes [Namespaces](/docs/previous/cloud/namespaces/) with one click.
- Download your [Kubernetes Credentials](/docs/previous/cloud/credentials/) to access your namespaces with `kubectl`, `helm`, or any other CLI tool.
- Set up [Personal Access Tokens](/docs/previous/cloud/personal-access-tokens/) to interact with Okteto Cloud's API.
- Visualize your workloads in a Developer-focused Kubernetes dashboard.
