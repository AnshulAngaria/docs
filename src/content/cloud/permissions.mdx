The reasons for requesting the above permissions are listed below.

### Repository Permissions

- Pull Requests: Pull Requests: Needed to comment on the pull requests with the deployed Preview Environment URL and to deploy/destroy a Preview Environment based on whether a PR has been opened/closed
- Commit Statuses: Needed to change the status of a commit to show if the Preview Environment for it was deployed successfully or not
