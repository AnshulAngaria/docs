Including a live preview of your changes on every pull request is a fantastic way to collaborate with your team's technical and non-technical members.

Okteto's preview environments are powered by Kubernetes and easily integrate with your favorite source control and CI/CD provider. And they use [the same pipelines](/docs/cloud/okteto-pipeline/) that you already use as part of your development workflow, so it's simple to get started.
