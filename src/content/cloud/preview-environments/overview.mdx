Preview environments allow you to include a live preview of your changes on every pull request. This is a fantastic way to collaborate with your team's technical, as well as non-technical members, to receive early feedback.

Okteto's preview environments are powered by Kubernetes and easily integrate with your favorite source control and CI/CD provider. And they use [the same pipelines](/docs/cloud/okteto-pipeline/) that you already use as part of your development workflow, so it's simple to get started. You can use Preview Environments with either [Okteto Cloud](/docs/cloud) or with [Okteto Self-Hosted](/docs/enterprise) if you want to run them on your Kubernetes infrastructure.
