There are two ways to configure [Preview Environments](/docs/cloud/preview-environments/preview-environments) using Okteto Cloud for your GitHub repositories. This page will be covering the easier of the two methods, that is, using the Okteto Cloud Dashboard. If you want more control and configuration options for your Preview Environments, [GitHub actions](/docs/cloud/preview-environments/preview-environments-github) are the way to go. Please ensure you've gone through the [Prerequisites](/docs/cloud/preview-environments/preview-environments/#prerequisites) section before proceeding with the steps here.

### Step 1: Log into Okteto Cloud

The first step is going to [Okteto Cloud](https://cloud.okteto.com/) and logging in. If you want your Preview Environments to get deployed on your own infrastructure instead of Okteto Cloud, you can check out Okteto Self-Hosted. 

Once you log in, head over to the Preview Environments section using the sidebar menu.

### Step 2: Choose Your Repository

Click on the "Add repository" button on top of the dashboard. If you're doing this for the first time, you'll have to install and authorize Okteto Cloud on the GitHub organization having the repository you want to configure the Preview Environments for. You can read more about what permissions Okteto Cloud requests and why over [here](/docs/cloud/permissions). 

Please note that you can only install Okteto Cloud for repositories belonging to your own GitHub account. Only org admins can install Okteto Cloud in the case of repositories part of a GitHub organization. Non-admin users will have the option of sending a request to install Okteto Cloud to admins through GitHub.

In this guide, we will set up Preview Environments for the repository under the Okteto GitHub organization. Suppose you don't have a repository [configured](/docs/cloud/preview-environments/preview-environments/#prerequisites). In that case, [you can fork this repository](https://github.com/okteto/go-guestbook) and configure Preview Environments on your fork to test them out.

Once you do that, you should see your repository appear in the list. Select it and click the "Add" button. Additionally, you can also configure variables for the repository. These variables are run-time variables that you would be referencing in your application code.

### Step 3: Make a Pull Request

That's right, this was all the configuration you needed to do! Head over to your repository now and make a pull request. After you make a pull request, Okteto will add the application endpoints to the PR as a comment once the Preview Environment has been deployed. 

Sharing this with team members is the best way to get their attention for reviews ðŸ˜›

### Next Steps

You've successfully configured Preview Environments for your GitHub repository and witnessed the magic of Okteto. However, this is only a part of what Okteto can do for your team's development workflow. You can take the next step towards enhancing your dev experience by looking at Okteto's [Development Environments](/docs/reference/development-environment).
