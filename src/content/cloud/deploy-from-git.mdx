This document covers how to deploy a development environment for a given Git repository.
Note that your Git repository needs to be configured with an [Okteto Pipeline](/docs/cloud/okteto-pipeline/).
Read the Okteto Pipeline [getting started guide](/docs/tutorials/getting-started-with-pipelines/) to learn how to create an Okteto Pipeline for your Git repository.

## Deploy

Log in to [Okteto Cloud](https://cloud.okteto.com), and click on the **Deploy** button on the top left.
A dialog will open asking for a Git repository to deploy. Make sure that "**Git URL**" is selected as the source.
Type the URL for the Movies App repo (https://github.com/okteto/movies), pick a branch, and click **Deploy**:

When you deploy a Git repository, Okteto Cloud will analyze your repo and automatically deploy it.
In the example above, Okteto will install the chart of the Movies App with Helm.

> Check the [Configuration section](/docs/cloud/okteto-pipeline/) to learn more about Okteto's auto deployment capabilities, and how to customize this with a `okteto-pipeline.yml` file.

As soon as your application is deployed, you'll see its state in the UI. The UI will be automatically updated as the different components are created. Your application will be ready to go once it reaches the `Success` state.

## Redeploy

Click the **Redeploy** button on the right of your application.

A dialog will open where you can modify the branch to redeploy:

<p align="center"><Image src="/docs/cloud/images/redeploy-git.png" alt="Redeploy in git" width="600" /></p>

Click **Deploy** and your applications will be updated with the source code of the given branch. This action will follow the same [Okteto Pipeline](/docs/cloud/okteto-pipeline/) as the [Deploy](#Deploy) action.

## Destroy

You can also destroy your application with a single click.

Go back to the extended menu of your application and click the **Destroy** button.
A confirmation dialog will pop up. Click on **Destroy** and your application and all of the resources created for it will be gone:

<p align="center"><Image src="/docs/cloud/images/destroy-git.png" alt="Destroy application" width="450" /></p>

You won't be able to recover resources after the application has been destroyed, so back up any sensitive data before running this action.

## Variables

When you deploy from Git, you can add Variables that will be available as environment variables during the execution of the pipeline.
