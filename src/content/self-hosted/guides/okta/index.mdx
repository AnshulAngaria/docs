#  Use Okta as your Identity Provider<TiersList tiers="Self-Hosted" />

This guide will walk you through the steps necessary to configure Okta as the authentication provider for your instace of Okteto. 

Please refer to [Okta's official documentation](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/oauth-openid/) on Open ID Connect for more information.

## Prerequisites

- An Instance of [Okteto](https://okteto.com/docs/self-hosted/).
- Helm 3.0+ installed in your local machine.
- Access to an Okta account with permissions to create Applications.

## Create the Okta Application

Create a new app integration, using the values below:

<p align="center"><Image src="/docs/self-hosted/guides/okta/images/new-app.png" alt="Create the new app" width="650" /></p>

Then, fill in the following values on the “New Web App Integration” window:

1. Name: The name of your app (e.g. Okteto)
2. Grant type: authorization code
3. Sign In Redirect: https://okteto.{YOUR_DOMAIN}/auth/callback
4. Assignments:  We recommend you create a dedicated group for Okteto, so you can control who can access your instance from Okta.

Leave all the other values empty, and press the save button.

<p align="center"><Image src="/docs/self-hosted/guides/okta/images/new-web-app-integration-2.png" alt="Create the new app integration" width="650" /></p>

Once the application has been created, copy the ClientID and the Client Secret. You'll need them to configure your Okteto Instance. 

<p align="center"><Image src="/docs/self-hosted/guides/okta/images/secrets.png" alt="Copy the client ID and the Client Secret" width="650" /></p>

Assign the users or groups that will have access to Okteto to the application that you just created.

<p align="center"><Image src="/docs/self-hosted/guides/okta/images/assignment.png" alt="Assign the users to the application" width="650" /></p>

By default, Okteto will use the attributes below when creating a user. 

- Name
- Nickname
- Email 
- Picture URL

Authentication will fail if `Nickname` or `Email` is missing. You can set these values at the User or the Application Assignment level. 

> Please refer to the [Customize the attributes that Okteto consumes](#customize-the-attributes-that-okteto-consumes) section below on how to change the attribute mapping that Okteto will use during authentication. 

If you want to pull the profile picture from Okta, you'll need to set the Picture URL” property of the user in Directory → People  → $User → Applications → $Application → Edit

<p align="center"><Image src="/docs/self-hosted/guides/okta/images/picture.png" alt="Update the picture URL value in the application assignment" width="650" /></p>

Finally, browse to https://{YOUR_TENANT}.okta.com/.well-known/openid-configuration, and copy the values below. You'll need them when configuring your Okteto instance.

- issuer
- authorization_endpoint

<p align="center"><Image src="/docs/self-hosted/guides/okta/images/well-known.png" alt="Get the URLs for authorization" width="650" /></p>

## Configure Okteto

Once you have the Okta application ready, you'll need to update the configuration of your Okteto Self-Hosted instance. 

First, update the auth section of your Helm configuration file (e.g. `values.yaml` ) with the values you obtained on the first step of this guide:

```yaml
auth:
  openid:
    enabled: true
    clientId: $CLIENT_ID
    clientSecret: $CLIENT_SECRET
    endpoints:
      issuer: $ISSUER_URL
      authorization: $AUTHORIZATION_URL
```

In our demo instance, this looks like: 

```
...
auth:
  opened:
    enabled: true    
    clientId: 0oa76rh0z5zgKG7XXXXX
    clientSecret: dTgsfHbYV9tt91Ng4dzvpULw6y7kjJaYxzfXXXXX
    endpoints:
      issuer: https://dev-6093102.okta.com
      authorization: https://dev-6093102.okta.com/oauth2/v1/authorize
...
```

> You can also store the value of clientSecret [as a secret directly in Kubernetes](/docs/self-hosted/install/deployment/#cloud-provider-secret).

Then, [upgrade your installation](/docs/self-hosted/install/upgrade/) to apply the changes. We recommend that you upgrade to the same version that you already have to minimize the changes and help with your troubleshooting. 

Once the upgrade has been completed, go to your instance and click on the 'Log In' button to access your instance using Okta as the authentication provider.

## Customize the attributes that Okteto consumes

By default, Okteto will use the attributes below when creating a user.

- `Name` as the display name of the user.
- `Nickname` as the username of the user.
- `Email` as the email.
- `Picture URL` for the user's profile picture.

If you are not using some of those values, or you want to customize which attributes get mapped, you can customize that by using the `mapping` field inside the `openid` key in your Helm configuration file.

```yaml
auth:
  openid:
    enabled: true
    clientId: $CLIENT_ID
    clientSecret: $CLIENT_SECRET
    endpoints:
      issuer: $ISSUER_URL
      authorization: $AUTHORIZATION_URL
    mapping:
      externalIDKey: nickname
      nameKey: name
      emailKey: email
      pictureKey: picture
```

The value of every key in the `mapping` section must match a `claim` in your Okta + OpenID configuration, and it must contain a non-empty value. 

For example, if you just want to use the `email` instead of the nickname for usernames, use the following configuration:

```yaml
auth:
  opened:
    enabled: true    
    clientId: 0oa76rh0z5zgKG7XXXXX
    clientSecret: dTgsfHbYV9tt91Ng4dzvpULw6y7kjJaYxzfXXXXX
    endpoints:
      issuer: https://dev-6093102.okta.com
      authorization: https://dev-6093102.okta.com/oauth2/v1/authorize
     mapping:
      externalIDKey: email
```

## Troubleshooting

### Log in fails with a 500 error

This is most likely because the user was not added to the application. Make sure that the user (or group if you are using them) is assigned to the application that you just created.

To fix this, go to Application → $Application → Assignments and add the required users or groups.
