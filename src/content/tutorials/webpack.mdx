### Expose webpack's dev server outside the container

In order to make your app reachable outside the container `webpack-dev-server` must be
configured to use `0.0.0.0` as host.

#### webpack.config.js
```js {4}
  module.exports = {
    //...
    devServer: {
      host: '0.0.0.0'
    }
  };
```

### Host check configuration

Webpack performs a host check when accessing the server. External access to the server won't be
allowed unless it's properly configured. Check [webpack's dev server documentation](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server)
for more information.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="webpack5"
  values={[
    { label: 'Webpack 5', value: 'webpack5', },
    { label: 'Webpack 4', value: 'webpack4', },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="webpack5">

You can bypass this check entirely by setting
the [`allowedHosts`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserverallowedhosts)
option to `all`:

#### webpack.config.js
```js {5}
  module.exports = {
    //...
    devServer: {
      host: '0.0.0.0',
      allowedHosts: 'all'
    }
  };
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="webpack4">

You can bypass this check entirely by setting
the [`disableHostCheck`](https://v4.webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserverdisablehostcheck)
option to `true`:

#### webpack.config.js
```js {5}
  module.exports = {
    //...
    devServer: {
      host: '0.0.0.0',
      disableHostCheck: true
    }
  };
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Watching files

Webpack uses the file system to get notified of file changes and enable features like hot-reloading.
You might experience file watching issues if your docker image is not compatible with webpack's
file system subsystem. If that's your case, enable the `polling` option:


```js {6,7,8}
  module.exports = {
    //...
    devServer: {
      host: '0.0.0.0',
      watchOptions: {
        poll: true // Or you can set a value in milliseconds.
      }
    }
  };
```

Check [webpack's documentation](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/watch/#watchoptions)
for more information about `watchOptions`.
